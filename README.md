Landing page for the Daily Northwestern's Best of Evanston edition

Notes for future Web Developers
1. Keep thumbnail photos under 2000 x 1000 px. I believe the smaller the better, but try to retain photo clarity. I think 1944 x 1296 is a good standard for the thumbnail images.

2. Cyber Duck does not work on eduroam. Connect to hotspot, or use one of the Daily computers with the apple box. I created all my code locally and then uploaded the code to github, and from there downloaded the code from github on a Daily desktop.
